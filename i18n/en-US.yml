LANGUAGE_PREFERENCE_HELP_SET@GUILD: |-
  This command allows you to change server-related internationalization settings. Use one of the following:

  • **`server_set language, <code>` to change language on server**:
  All newcomers to server and unknown users to the bot will start using this language by default.

  • **`server_set timezone, <time zone>` to change the server time zone**:
  This will set a server time zone that may be used by various modules (for example, logging). This does not change the time zone for users on the server.

  • **`server_set enforce, <state: +/-/true/false>` to enable or disable language enforcing mode**:
  Enforcing mode forces users to use the server language when they call command on the server. Outside the server they will still be able to use whatever language they want.

LANGUAGE_PREFERENCE_HELP_SET@USER: |-
  This command allows you to change your internationalization settings. Use one of the following:
